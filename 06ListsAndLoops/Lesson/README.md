1.  `sum13`

    From [codingbat](https://codingbat.com/prob/p167025):

    Return the sum of the numbers in the array, returning 0 for an empty array. Except the number 13 is very unlucky, so it does not count and numbers that come immediately after a 13 also do not count.

    ```
    sum13([1, 2, 2, 1]) → 6
    sum13([1, 1]) → 2
    sum13([1, 2, 2, 1, 13]) → 6
    ```

1.  `sum67`

    From [codingbat](https://codingbat.com/prob/p108886):

    Return the sum of the numbers in the array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 and extending to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7).

    ```
    sum67([1, 2, 2]) → 5
    sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) → 5
    sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) → 4
    ```

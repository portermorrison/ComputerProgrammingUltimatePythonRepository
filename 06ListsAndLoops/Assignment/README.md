1. `count_failing_grades`

   Write a function that takes a list of percent grades as input. It should return the number of failing (less than 60%) grades.

1. `count_act_scores`

   Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input. It should count how many of those numbers are valid ACT scores (minimum score is 1, maximum is 36), and return that count.

1. `number_sum`

   Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input. It should return the sum of the numbers in the list.

1. `average_act_score`

   Write a function that takes a list of numbers. Some of them are valid ACT scores, others are not. The function should calculate the mean of the numbers that are valid ACT scores (and ignore the numbers that are outside the range), then return that mean.

1. `all_true`

   Write a function that takes a list of boolean (`True` or `False`) values. It should return `True` if they are all `True`, and `False` otherwise.

1. `any_true`

   Write a function that takes a list of boolean values. It should return `True` if any of the values are `True`, and `False` otherwise.

1. `mostly_true` (+)

   Write a function that takes a list of boolean values. It should return `True` if most of them are `True`, and `False` otherwise.

1. `has_vowel`

   Write a function that takes a list of single characters as input. It should return `True` if any of the characters in the list is a vowel. If none of them are, return `False`

1. `all_the_same`

   Take a list of integers as input. The list will have at least one element. Return `True` if every number in the list is the same, and `False` otherwise

1. `increasing`

   Take a list of integers as input. The list will have at least two elements. Return `True` if the numbers are strictly increasing (adjacent numbers being equal doesn't count as strictly increasing), and `False` otherwise.

1. `is_incrementing`

   Take a list of integers as input. The list will have at least two elements. Return `True` if the numbers are incrementing (increasing by one), and `False` otherwise.

1. `has_adjacent_repeat`

   Take a list of integers as input. The list will have at least two elements. Return `True` if there is an "adjacent repeat", that is, if somewhere in the list the same number appears twice in a row. If there are no adjacent repeats, return `False`.

1. `sum_with_skips`

   Take a list of integers as input. Return the sum of all the integers, except ignore sections of the list between instances of -1. For example, [1, 2, 3, -1, 4, 5, 6, -1, 7] should return 1 + 2 + 3 + 7 = 13.

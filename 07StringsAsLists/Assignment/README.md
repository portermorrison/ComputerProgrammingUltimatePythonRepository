1. `is_alliteration`

    Take two arguments that are words. Return `True` if the words form an alliteration (both words have the same first letter), and `False` otherwise.

1. `count_vowels`
    
    Take a single word as an argument. Return the number of vowels in the word.

1. `count_numbers`
    
    Take a string as an argument. Return the number of numerical digits in the word.

1. `count_target_letters`
    
    Take two arguments: a string representing a word, and a single character (a string with length 1). Return the number of times the single character occurs in the word.

1. `in_alphabetical_order`
    
    Take a string representing a word as input. Return `True` if every letter in the word appears in alphabetical order, and `False` otherwise.

1. `alternate_case`

    Take a string representing a word as input. Return a new string which is the same word as the input, except the case alternates upper-lower-upper-lower-.... For example, "python" would become "PyThOn"

1. `remove_vowels`

    Take a string as input. Return a new string which is the same as the input, except any vowels have been removed.

1. `to_camel_case`

    Take a string as input which represents a phrase (words separated by spaces). Return a new string which contains the same phrase, except in camelCase. This means spaces are removed, and each word's first letter is uppercased. This is a common way to name variables in many programming languages (but not Python, which uses snake_case)

1. `to_snake_case`

    Take a string as input which represents a phrase (words separated by spaces). Return a new string which contains the same phrase, except in snake_case. This means spaces are replaced by underscores.

1. `without_duplicates`

    Take a list of integers as input. Return a new list which contains the same numbers, except any adjacent repeats of numbers are omitted.

1. `filter_valid_act_scores`

    Take a list of integers are input. Return a new list which contains only the numbers that represent valid ACT scores (1 is the lowest score, 36 is the highest)
